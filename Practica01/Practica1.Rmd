This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
a <- runif(25, min= 160 , max = 200)
pesos<-matrix(a, ncol = 5 ,nrow = 5) 
colnames(pesos) <- c("ENERO","FEBRERO","MARZO","ABRIL","MAYO")
rownames(pesos) <- c("Rodri" , "Elias" , "Leo" , "Diego","Ochoa")
View(pesos)
meanRow <- rowMeans(pesos,  na.rm = TRUE)
meanCol <- colMeans(pesos, na.rm = TRUE)
pesos <- cbind(pesos, promedioRow = meanRow)
pesos <- rbind(pesos, promedioCol = meanCol)
View(pesos)
```
